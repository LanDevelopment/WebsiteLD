		What are the unique benefits of the property?
	</b>
</p>

<p>
	Our cottages are mainly converted from old barns to a high standard to provide comfort during your stay. We offer a very quiet location but are also only a short drive from the beach at Woolacombe and walking distance to Lee Village across adjacent fields with access to exmoor. During your stay we offer the chance to feed our orphan lambs, pigs and other small animals

	The Farm
</h2>

<p>
	Allender Farm is a traditional North Devon farmhouse built at the turn of the last century. It is situated at the end of a long attractive drive of half a mile and offers outstanding views of the Lee Valley and surrounding countryside. Set in delightful grounds of just over 3 acres, the property offers the seclusion of the country, for those wanting to get away from it all - yet is only 3 miles from the 'Blue Flag' beach at Woolacombe with its outstanding sandy expanse. The beach extends to some 3 miles and connects to Putsborough. We are also within easy reach of the beaches at Mortehoe, Croyde.
</p>

<p>
	 In season we have guinea foul, chickens, ducks, turkeys, lambs, pigs, guinea-pigs and an incubator house for hatching our eggs from Easter until the end of the summer holidays and ask our visitors to join us twice daily for "feeding time", egg collection and general help as part of their holiday enjoyment. 
</p>

<p>
	Our holiday accommodation is mainly converted from traditional existing barns and out-buildings to a high standard with your comfort in mind. For the children, we have arranged a play area with a swing, climbing frame, slide and various other toys to allow them to burn off excess energy and give parents a break.
</p>

<p>
	For the adults we have B-B-Q's  for those wishing to cook outside and enjoy the un-spoilt views when eating.
</p>

<p>
	A twenty five minute walk down an adjacent footpath through fields and woods leads to the village of Lee. At low tide a small sandy beach is exposed with rock pools and is a delight for the children and grown-ups too.
