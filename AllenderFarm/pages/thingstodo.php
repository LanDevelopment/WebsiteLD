	All of our younger visitors had fun helping with the feeding of the animals and if they would admit it so do some of the adults. This was the focus both in the morning and in the evening for a number of our guests while still allowing the day to be free to enjoy the attractions on offer locally. We  have chickens, ducks, guinea-pigs, a guinea foul &amp; pigs.
	For those not wanting any involvement with the animals Allender Farm provides a wonderful base to explore North Devon from.
</p>

<p>
	Visitors have reported seeing many common buzzards, a pair of nuthatches with their young, yellowhammers, a pied and yellow wagtail, two types of woodpeckers, robins, sparrows and wrens in and around our garden so it's worth keeping your eyes open to see if you can add to the list which we will happily mention. A robin  nested in the garden and a pied wagtail successfully raised chicks in a nest in the garage as did a wren that took over an old swallows nest!

	A pleasant 25 minute walk down through fields and woods takes you to Lee, a pretty village nestling in the 'Fuchsia' valley with a traditional old North Devon pub offering home made food. Lee's small cove is sandy at low tide and has many rock pools, which are a delight for children. The village offers access to the coastal footpath offering the walker beautiful rugged scenery at any time of the year. The more adventurous guests may walk a round trip leading to Mortehoe via the coast line then inland back to the cottage in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Mortehoe is a small, traditional, unspoiled slate roofed village which offers a general store, restaurants and village pubs. This leads down into Woolacombeâ€™s glorious Blue Flag beach of golden sand and offers superb surfing and body boarding which are extensively catered for locally. Lifeguards are posted in the season on the main beach. Between Mortehoe and Woolacombe are several quiet small coves for those wishing to miss the crowds. Similar smaller sandy beaches can be found at Putsborough and Croyde which are good additional areas for surfing.

<p>
	The Victorian resort of Ilfracombe (4 miles away) offers an active fishing harbor where bookings to Lundy Island may be made, a variety of restaurants and where verity takes a place of pride. The Landmark Theatre and the famous cave tunnels. Barnstable lies 14 miles distant, with its wide range of shops, daily pannier market, Queens Theatre and summer flower-filled streets, attracting visitors throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
	The outstanding, rugged Heritage coastline and unrivalled beauty of Exmoor National Park are only a short drive away and offer wonderful walking or touring at all times of the year.
</p>

<p>
	Being at the "heart" of the "Tarka Trail" makes cycling on the many dedicated tracks and trails a very popular activity and the hire of bicycles can be arranged locally. Local stables offer those who want to try their hand at horse riding - either as a beginner or at an expert level - the chance to have fun. There are many gardens open under the National Gardens Scheme in the county, as well as the more recognized gardens such as the RHS Rosemoor at Great Torrington and Marwood Hill near Lee. Golf courses are located nearby which are open to non-members.
</p>

<p>
	Finally there are many commercial activities in the area. Details and brochures are given to our customers on arrival.
